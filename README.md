# EVE Mineral Compare WordPress Shortcode

Adds a shortcode [eve_mineral_compare] to display two simple tables calling the prices of the "basic 8" minerals across the five major trade hubs and their neighboring markets in EVE Online

Price Data is cached in `wp-content/uploads/eve-mineral-compare/cache`.

A "Refresh Prices" button appears at the bottom of the tables. If the cache is older than 6 hours, price data will be called and update. If it is younger than 6 hours, it will use the cached data.

I do not plan to expand the functionality of this plugin and consider it complete.
